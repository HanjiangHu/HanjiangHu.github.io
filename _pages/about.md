I am a master student in [Autonomous Robot Lab](http://robotics.sjtu.edu.cn/index.php?r=site/index) at Shanghai Jiao Tong University advised by Prof. [Hesheng Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=q6AY9XsAAAAJ).

My research interests lie in **visual perception**, **long-term localization**, and **domain adaptation** for autonomous vehicles and mobile robots. I am very open to collaborating with others and have tried other robotic fields, e.g., soft robot, multi-agent control system, etc.
